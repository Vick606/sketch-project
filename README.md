Project: Etch-A-Sketch

Introduction

Welcome to the Etch-A-Sketch project! In this project, I will be developing a neat toy to flex my DOM manipulation skills. This project involves creating a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch.

Objective

The primary focus of this project is to refresh my skills by finding and implementing the right JavaScript methods and CSS techniques. I will leverage the skills I've learned throughout my journey with The Odin Project, as well as additional skills gained through independent research.

Technologies Used

- HTML5: To structure the web page.
- CSS3: For styling the page and making it visually appealing.
- JavaScript: For DOM manipulation and adding interactive features.

Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/etch-a-sketch.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd etch-a-sketch
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the project.

Usage

- Hover over the grid to draw.
- Use the color picker to select a drawing color.
